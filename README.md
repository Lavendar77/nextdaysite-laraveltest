### Solutions
#### 1. Excel Upload System
Store random data generated by you for over 100k data. The fields should contain First Name, Last Name, Email and Telephone.

##### Task Process
Even though this task is very confusing because there is **"upload" in the title** and then **"random data generated by you"** ðŸ˜•
1. Create a route "generate random data" that collects a number.
2. Generate the specified number of `users` using Faker.
3. Create an export download of that data.
4. Create an upload feature of XLSX.
5. Store data from the upload.

**Note: If file is too large, queue it up!**

#### 2. Advert Application
Capture advert banner upload and record the number of times each advert should randomly display and the total number of times per impression.

##### Task Process
1. Create an upload feature that accepts an image.
2. Create a repository of randomly display adverts (5).
3. Record the times the above adverts were picked.
4. Create a modal that shows the advert in the real view.
5. Record the click as an impression for the advert.
6. Create a tabulated record of all uploaded adverts.
|   ID  |   Name    |   Size    | No of Random Views | No of Impressions |
| ----- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1     | UEFA      | 15KB      | 2                  | 1                 |

#### 3. API Search
Generate 300,000 `users -> firstname, lastname, email, telephone` using seeders. Then, build an API to view all and perform a search query.

##### Task Process
1. Create a `users` table.
2. Create a seeder to fake data into the data.
